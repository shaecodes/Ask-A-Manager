# Ask-A-Manager-Data-Analysis

Ask a Manager Salary Survey is a Google Form Document created by Allison Green to collect information from workers across the world. The survey asks for the worker's age group, industry they work in, annual salary, ethnicity, and work experience. The survey accepts data from persons both inside and outside of the USA.

The data collected from the survey is stored in a CSV file called askamanager.csv. However, the data in this file is extremely messy, with numerous null values and inconsistent data.

The primary goal of this project is to learn how to clean data, as data analysts spend most of their time preparing data for analysis. By working on this project, I will gain experience working with data in its raw form and identify inconsistencies, errors, and missing information.

To begin the cleaning process, I will need to identify and address the null values and inconsistent data in the file. Once the data is cleaned, I will be able to manipulate and transform it to gain insights, identify patterns, and make informed decisions based on my findings.

By completing this project, I hope to develop essential skills in data manipulation, transformation, and visualization, which are crucial for data analysis. These skills will help me work more efficiently and effectively with data, and I will be better equipped to handle complex data analysis tasks in the future.
